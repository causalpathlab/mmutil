# Installation

* Try `configure --help` to figure out appropriate options in your system.

* `make` and `make install` will install binary files

* `R` API in a separate project. Try this: in `R`:

`> devtools::install_github("YPARK/mmutilR")`

(You need `Rcpp`, `RcppEigen`, and `tidyverse`)

* `pip3 install -e .` will install Python API (experimental)
